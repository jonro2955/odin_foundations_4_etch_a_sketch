### Focus  
- Creating dynamic webpages with JS functions that construct html strings that are inserted into DOM as inner html elements to create more elements.
- Using event listeners, and listening for multiple events in one element. 
- Converting hex colours to rgb.
- DOM, element and style manipulation using javascript.
- Using html color input elements.
- Adding additional functionalities by creating extra variables to store default, current, and previous values, and making correct data transitions among them inside the relevant functions. This is important if you want to have multiple functionalities in your app where turing one thing on requres automatically turning the others off to ensure that there are no unexpected behaviours.
